Allows TinyPNG to be executed from the command line for lossless image compression.

**Install**

`compose global require etre2/tinypng-console`

Ensure that `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin directory` is in your $PATH so that the `tinypng` command is available system-wide. This path may very from OS-to-OS.
